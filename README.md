# Ethereum-Projects

This repository contains my Ethereum and Blockchain Projects using Solidity and Javascript. The list of my projects in this repo are:

1.  **ShopDapp:** A Solidity smart contract for a decentralized shop, allowing the owner to list products, users to buy products, and the owner to withdraw funds, with item and order management features
   
2. **HeavenToken(ERC20 Token):** A Solidity smart contract for the HeavenToken, an ERC20 token with cap, burn, and custom block reward functionality, allowing the owner to manage the reward and self-destruct the contract while ensuring miner rewards are capped.

3. **Lottery Smart Contract:** A Solidity smart contract implementing a lottery system where participants contribute 1 ether, and the manager can randomly select a winner when certain conditions are met, transferring the contract's balance to the winner.
   
4. **Event Organization Smart Contract:** A Solidity smart contract for creating, buying, and transferring event tickets with organizer and attendee functionality, including checks for event existence, future date, ticket availability, and payment verification
